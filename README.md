GNSS
====

This is a port of the Apollo GNSS driver to pure ROS. We remove
dependencies on the protocol buffer messaging infrastructure used by
Apollo.

This driver has been tested to work with a Novatel ProPak 6 on the
University of Nevada, Reno's MKZ platform.

This work was supported by the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic
Development and the State of Nevada's Knowledge Fund.
